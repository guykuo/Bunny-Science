Universal x-carriage allows your choice of Bear or Prusa carriage with your choice of extruder. Bear/BNB, Prusa, and Bondtech upgrade extruders are supported....

This BNB extruder x-carriage has belt paths for both Bear and Prusa x-axes. The upper one is for Bear x-axis, the lower one is for Prusa x-axis. Push belt ends into slot corresponding to your axis.

Because this is based on the BNB Easy Motor Service carriage for Bear extruder, you also gain simple motor bolt access for BNB and Bear extruders.

BNB Short Ears extruder should clear stock Prusa motor x-end when used with this carriage.

For Bear and BNB family extruders...
This carriage also moves extruder 1.5 mm closer to x-axis, but maintains same dimensions for most bolts inserted through x-carriage. Note that the middle air plenum bolt that connects extruder body to x-carriage must be shortened from 10 mm to 7 mm. That was the only Bear/BNB family bolt for which there was no clearance available to compensate for the thinner carriage.

For Prusa extruders...
Carriage is 1.5 mm thinner than Prusa x-carriages but bolt bore depths were compensated to maintain bolt lengths. However, please verify proper fitment. Most critical are the two MK3S R4 extruder bolts passing through the hot end air plenum. Please verify your bolt lengths before tightening. Also, cable dress should be done "Bear" style rather than following Prusa conventions.

Combined with the BNB Short Ear Extruders' already pushed back motor, this carriage moves the motor to a fraction of a mm in front of the Z-axis T-nut

I have verified this carriage on both Bear and Prusa x-axes. It works as intended. Just be certain to use the correct insertion slot - Top for Bear, bottom for Prusa. Also, it is best to insert a short pit (two teeth long is sufficient) of belt into the empty slot BEFORE attaching belt ends.

Genuine Gates 2GT belts are thinner and much easier to insert than the Chinese GT2 belts I have in stock. I would build in more clearance for the belts, but there is very little space available without weakening the belt grips.

Testing on both axes reminded me why I switched to the Bear axis. It is SO MUCH easier to attach drive belt and get correct tension on the Bear axis. None the less, this universal x-carriage lets you run a BNB or Bear extruder on the Prusa x-axis.

As in the Skelestruder, you should stiffen the belt holding teeth of the carriage by stuffing the unused belt path with a two tooth long, piece of 2GT belt.

Please print all three parts of this carriage rather than attempting to mix with older x-covers.

**** If used with short body MKS3 sensor extruders, Double check lead dress for hot end wires when x-carriage is max left and print bed max forward BEFORE XYZ calibration. Use current BNB Universal x-carriage which has better cable passage for hot end. ***

Change Log

Chamfered Prusa belt path for easier belt insertion

Increase belt gap slightly to accomodate non-genuine 2GT2 belts.
Reinforced upper bearing surrounds 

Added breakaway tab for compatibility with future BNB MK3S edition

Made more universal by adding support for Prusa MK3S R4 extruder bolt pattern. (MK3 R3 was already compatible)

Increased width of MK3S connector slot 0.5 mm

Reduced right leg of x-carriage and lower cover to permit safe passage of heater cartridge and thermistor wires. Right leg is secured via M2 x 8 to 10 mm screw. New design is critical for short body (MK3S sensored) extruders that position carriage 5.5 mm lower. The lowered carriage position posed a huge risk for cable damage during XYZ calibration.

Added support fin for heater cartridge cables
Increased rear clearance for heat block for short body extruders.
Added closer to carriage, zip tie hole for hot end cables.

BNB2S Further increased clearance from heat block. Cleaner removal intrinsic support for M2 screw tab

Top cover filament cable slot now straight down.
Stiffened bottom cover by removing filament cable slot. 
Corrected old misalignment of motor bolt hole

BNB3S Reoriented slot and guide to shift hot end cable path centrally. 

BNB4S Increased hot end cable passage size. M2 bolt head recess enlarged.

Added BNB MK2.5S x-carriage for MK2.5S printers that require x-stop end block. This is not plated, but supplied as just the STL file.

Moved BNB MK2.5S x-carriage for MK2.5S to Short Ears MK2.5 MK2.5S Support Package

Post print
Remove breakaway portion of hot end cable guide fin. The hot end cable guide fin now points towards center of carriage. This helps keep cable away from vertical printer frame. Reversed direction also increased safe cable passage space.

If using with MK3S sensor, remove tab at top of carriage. You may need to score  the perforated sections with a knife before breaking away the tab.

There is no longer a support to be removed from M2 bolt tab of lower carriage cover.
