This kit has E3D style groove mount adapter and hot fins to use Mosquito hot end with either Short Ears extruder. Extruder must be version B02M3 or later to accept the adapter this kit. Older version extruders will not accept this kit.

Because Mosquito heat sink is wider than the E3DV6. Bunnies enlarged air plenums of the Short Ears extruders to accommodate the Mosquito, but keep E3DV6 airflow optimized via removable panes.

Bunny Science Short Ears extruders have a special shaped hot end cover that engages with the adapters and spacer of this kit to give the mount anti-rotation feature. You perform Mosquito style, one-hand nozzle change with this kit and a Bunny Science extruder.

Square shouldered groove adapter in kit can also be used with other extruders, provided they have wide enough air plenum. However, non-Bunny Science extruders will lack the anti-rotation feature of this kit.

Omit the E3DV6 panes and hot fins from your Short Ears extruder. Install mosquito specific hot fins from this kit. E3DV6 Plenum panes are not used with Mosquito. They are removed to make space for the Mosquito. 

Orient the anti-rotation flat of groove adapter or spacer faces forward to engage hot end cover! 

Mosquito attaches to adapter in this kit via two M2.5 x 16 mm screws and nuts.

PTFE clamp uses 2 M2 x 6 mm screws

Air flow plenum wall is quite thin when E3D plenum is removed. Please verify middle M3 x 8mm screw attaching extruder to x-carriage does not impinge Mosquito heat sink.

PTFE tube from Mosquito should be 27.5 mm on BNBSX MK3S
PTFE tube from Mosquito should be 33.5 mm on BNB Short Ears MK3

Cut slightly longer than spec and trim after checking against your actual extruder build. 

PTFE ends are to be cut square on both ends. You can use one of the groove adapter as convenient square cut tome. Slide PTFE tubing to cut position then briskly slide blade along flat surface of PTFE. A quick cut produces a more square result than a slow pass.

Bondtech end of PTFE should be interior chamfered by hand rotating a medium sized drill bit. Clear away all cuttings! Be certain no PTFE debris gets into extruder.

Two versions of the groove mount adapter are provided. The one with chamfering at top of its waist prints cleanly without supports. However, it will ONLY fit Short Ears extruders. 

The version with 90 degree overhang at top of its waist must be printed with supports. Its advantage is it can be used with non-Short Ears extruders (provided air plenums are wide enough for a Mosquito)

Both versions are plated in the 3mf.

Alternatively, use the nicely machined, aluminum groove mount coupling from Printed Solid. https://www.printedsolid.com/products/groove-mount-coupling-with-tapped-holes-for-slice-engineering-mosquito-hotend  

The aluminum PS coupling includes usual E3D clamping mechanism.

Add kit's 3 mm spacer and use longer M2.5 screws when using the Printed Solid groove adapter. The 3mm spacer is needed to position Mosquito nozzle to pass Prusa XYZ calibration. The spacer has a top and bottom. Orient 3mm spacer so its anti-rotation flat is at bottom of the spacer. The top of the spacer should have about 0.5 mm without the flats.

Notes:
As of B03M1, fan shrouds and hotend hot fin now interlock via an "Evan" hook. Install shrouds by engaging hook first and then inserting mounting screw. Fan shroud installation is easier with print fan screws loosened.

Elephant footing or excessively low Live-Z may reduce bore diameters at bottom of prints. Use drill bit to clear out bores to correct size.

Due to unavoidable tight spacing, there are open slots in the groove adapter. The slots do not affect functionality.

Don't go crazy tightening the PTFE clamp. Just get it snug.

Users were had difficulty finding a fan shroud that will fit asymmetrically wide Mosquito hot end. 

A wider shroud was remixed from RHD air nozzle for kit.

Use Nylock nut to mount fan shroud rather than regular M3 hex nut. Wider fan shroud may gradually tilt downward if screws loosens. Nylock better secures fan shroud. However, new Evan hook helps avoid that problem.

Use PETG nozzle as bootstrap to print next one in ABS or Polycarbonate. PETG should last long enough to get through one print. Alternatively, print high temp version BEFORE installing Mosquito.
